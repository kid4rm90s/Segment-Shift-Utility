# <p align="center">WME Segment Shift Utility</p>

Now, when "Disconnect Nodes" is checked, the entire selected segment should shift and become disconnected from its original nodes and when unchecked, the entire selected segments including its connected segments' junction nodes also shift. Please test this version carefully, especially the disconnect functionality, and let me know if it's working correctly now!

## Instructions
1) Install this script in Tampermonkey.
2) Open the Waze Map Editor.
3) Select segments.
4) To shift segments and move connected nodes (normal behavior): Leave "Disconnect Nodes" unchecked.
5) To shift segments and disconnect them: Check "Disconnect Nodes".
6) Use the shift buttons.
