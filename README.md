# <p align="center">WME Segment Shift Utility</p>

Now, when "Disconnect Nodes" is checked, the entire selected segment should shift and become separated from its original nodes; when unchecked, the entire selected segment, including the junction nodes of its related segments, likewise shift. Please carefully try this version, particularly the disconnect capability, and let me know whether it is now operating as intended.

## Instructions
1) Install this script in Tampermonkey.
2) Open the Waze Map Editor.
3) Select segments.
4) To shift segments and move connected nodes (normal behavior): Leave "Disconnect Nodes" unchecked.
5) To shift segments and disconnect them: Check "Disconnect Nodes".
6) Use the shift buttons.
